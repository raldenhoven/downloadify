# tidalWave (formerly downloadify)

## installation
1. download/clone repo
2. add your creds to javascripts/inject.js
3. add as unpacked extension to chrome

## issues
repetitive downloads because of the way the extension detects playing. someone fix it and send in that pull request.

### about
so we took the TIDAL hype and made something good out of it. all credit goes to downloadify developer for codebase, it's just been modified for TIDAL

to TIDAL devs: smart move encrypting(?) your sound files on desktop, but mobile's got no such protection.

to interested devs: nothing interesting really, just ping api for streamUrl with mobile session instead of desktop session to get unencrypted M4A, then download

don't really expect this to work for much longer, but whatever *shrug*
